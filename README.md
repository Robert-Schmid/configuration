# Personal configuration files



The original goal was to have a system where all permanent installations and configurations are done only in this repository and pushed to the system via scripts.
NixOS seemed like the way to go, but was ultimately too niche and difficult to get into for me.

Now I'm on Manjaro and the original dream died a little bit, but I plan to learn more about [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) and return to NixOS on a spare machine sometime in the future.

### Old Stuff

#### NixOs

Has been a nice experiment and NixOS is definitly a lot more user-friendly than a couple years ago, but still too much of a hassle for a personal desktop. Unless you really know your way about building from source, linux basics, and have the time to do these things.
Or if you want to learn, rolling back after mistakes is super easy and you can try everything out. It's great to learn about linux, but maybe install it on a spare machine as it's quite difficult to be immediately productive.

#### Kakoune

Still prefer Kakoune over Vim and everything else, and it's easier to get into.
But less users means less support, documentation, and add-ons.
It's great and I hope to come back one day, but for now learning to use Vim is a better investment.
