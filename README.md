# Personal configuration files

### Branch Info

Try i3-gaps and X11 and upgrade to NixOs 21.05

___

The goal is to have a system where all permanent installations and configurations are done only in this repository and pushed to the system via scripts.

Currently I do development in docker containers, but I plan to learn more about flakes and nix-shells.
