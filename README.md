# Personal configuration files

The goal is to have a system where all permanent installations and configurations are done only in this repository and pushed to the system via scripts.

Currently I do development in docker containers, but I plan to learn more about flakes and nix-shells.

### Acknowledgement

So far all this is heavily based on the configuration files from [alexherbo2](https://github.com/alexherbo2/configuration)
